## Me and my interests

I am a software engineer at [Faculty][Faculty-website], where I work on a data
science platform. This is giving me the opportunity to dive into the ecosystem
of data-related technologies, on which I might at some point write something.

I graduated from [Imperial College London][ICL] in Computing (MEng). For my
dissertation I worked on a framework for type driven concurrent programming,
hence my interest for concurrency, actors and message passing.

I will use this blog as a corner to organise my thoughts and share my experience
on topics and projects that I am currently working on.

## This blog

I write this blog with two goals in mind.

Firstly, I find that writing things down helps my learning process, by clarifying ideas and cementing concepts in my head. As such don't expect these posts to be particularly rigorous or necessarily accurate. Although I will make an effort to curate the content (this is the point of putting this on a public place in the first place), this blog is very much a mental workbench where I am quite content to post WIP opinions and ideas.

The second reason for this blog has to do with this being a public space. Since I write this blog as this is an exercise to clarify things for myself, I may come up with intuitions that could be useful to others. Alternatively people might read my confused ramblings and decide to provide clarification/feedback. Either of the two would count as a success in my book.
