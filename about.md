I am a software engineer at [Faculty][Faculty-website], where I work on a data
science platform. This is giving me the opportunity to dive into the ecosystem
of data-related technologies, on which I might at some point write something.

I graduated from [Imperial College London][ICL] in Computing (MEng). For my
dissertation I worked on a framework for type driven concurrent programming,
hence my interest for concurrency, actors and message passing.

I will use this blog as a corner to organise my thoughts and share my experience
on topics and projects that I am currently working on.
